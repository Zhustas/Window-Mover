# Window-Mover
Move your windows to your main monitor.  
It is useful only if you have more than 1 monitor.  
I made this, so that you won't need to plug in your other monitor in order to move a needed window to your main monitor.

## Language
I made this program using python language.

## Python modules
I used 2 modules: **tkinter** and **pygetwindow**.
To install PyGetWindow run this:
```
pip install PyGetWindow
```
