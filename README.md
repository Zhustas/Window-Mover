# Window-Mover
Move your windows to your main monitor.  
It is useful only if you have more than 1 monitor.  
I made this, so that you won't need to plug in your other monitor in order to move a needed window to your main monitor.

## Language
I made this program using python language.

## Python modules
I used 2 modules: **tkinter**, **pygetwindow**, **requests**, **beautifulsoup**.  

To install **pygetwindow** run this:
```
pip install PyGetWindow
```
To install **requests** run this:
```
pip install requests
```
To install **beautifulsoup** run this:
```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
